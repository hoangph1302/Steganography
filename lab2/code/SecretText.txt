The county's coronavirus totals now stand at 4,020 confirmed cases and 144 deaths, but officials said numbers were trending in the right direction and thanked San Diegans for behaving responsibly this weekend as beaches opened allaying fears of overcrowding and subsequent statemandated closures. County Supervisors Greg Cox and Nathan Fletcher announced they are planning to introduce a framework to reopen nonessential businesses at Tuesday's board morning, and the county is preparing to loosen business restrictions on some retail stores in conjunction with the state on Friday. Even with a future course charted for reopening the state, officials reminded residents to be diligent about social distancing and facial coverings. State public health authorities are opening testing locations in partnership with the county's health agency starting Tuesday. California Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon is calling lawmakers back to the Capitol on Monday, restarting a legislative session interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, even as a handful of lawmakers plan to stay home for fear of contracting or spreading the disease. With such a compressed calendar, lawmakers are having to rethink their policy goals. The Assembly's 32 committees must share the three hearing rooms large enough for lawmakers and the public to stay at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart, likely limiting the number of bills they can consider.
